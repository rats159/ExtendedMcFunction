# Extended McFunction
This project aims to improve datapack creation, while still preserving the feel of tradiontal mcfunction files.

XMF is a superset of regular commands. Any valid .mcfunction file should work the exact same as a .xmf file.

Features XMF adds:
- Inline functions
- C-Style macros
- Inline math, evaluated at compile-time
- A standard library
- A special syntax for calling functions with arguments more easily
