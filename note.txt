XMF is a superset of regular commands. Any valid .mcfunction file should work the exact same as a .xmf file.
Features XMF adds:
    - Inline functions
    - C-Style macros
    - Inline math, evaluated at compile-time
    - A standard library
    - A special syntax for calling functions with arguments more easily
